# Crazy Eights
This program allows one player to play a game of Crazy Eights against the computer. Crazy Eights is a game that uses a standard deck of 52 cards. Specifically, each card has a rank and a suit. There are 13 ranks: the numbers 2 through 10, Jack (usually represented with the letter J), Queen (Q), King (K), and Ace (A). There are 4 suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades. In a 52-card deck, there is one card of each rank for each suit.

A game of Crazy Eights between two players proceeds as follows:

The deck of cards is shuffled, randomizing the order of the cards.
Each player is dealt 7 cards.
The remaining cards are placed face-down (i.e. with their rank and suit hidden) in a stack on the table and becomes the "stock", with the top card turned over and displayed in a separate "pile".
One of the players (player A) begins the game by playing a card from their hand that is the same suit or same rank as the top card on the pile, which becomes the new top of the pile. 
Player B then plays a card from their hand that is the same suit or rank as the top card, which becomes the new top of the pile. 
If a player does not have any cards of the required rank or suit, they must draw from the top of the deck (stock) and add cards to their hand until they draw a card that can be played on the pile, or until the deck runs out of cards.
The game continues with the players alternating turns until one of the players gets rid of all the cards in their hand, or until all of the cards are drawn and no one can play a card. If neither player has zero cards at the end of the game, the player with the least amount of cards in their hand wins.
Eights of any suit are considered "wild" and may be played on any turn. When an eight is played, the player must specify a suit for the next player to match.
